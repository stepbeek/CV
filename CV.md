# Work Experience
## Amazon.com
### SDE on the Dynamic Merchandising team 
#### October 2015 - Current

At Amazon, I've served as an developer on an agile team of three, building the platform that renders all personalized widgets across Amazon's browse pages. I've been instrumental in the both the construction of the system in Scala with Akka, and in drastically improving the operational aspects - including increasing success rates from ~90% to ~99.9%. In this DevOps culture my most recent achievements have been in implementing a great deal of functionality for Amazon Fresh under tight deadlines and in progressing the system to be continuously deployed. 

Within this role I traversed the entire stack from front end CSS issues to deep dives into the underlying implementation of Scala reflection on the server side.

### Software Developer on the Pyramid Position Service
#### August 2014 - October 2015

A distributed, Agile team across Glasgow and London with clients globally, the main function of the Pyramid Position Service is to serve up enriched position data for the Investment Bank’s equities tech. My role involved full stack development - from web-based latency tracking and testing tools, to back-end performance and data quality work. I spend the vast majority of this role working on back-end java, with the high point being distributed data server with a 99th latency percentile of 4ms and fans out at a throughput of around 150,000 msg/sec (message size 512 bytes) to multiple clients over the network using a combination of RxJava and a pure Java implementation of ZeroMQ, JeroMQ.

### L3 Unix Intern
#### June 2014 - August 2014

I worked within the L3 Unix team during my Summer internship with JPMC. During this time, I worked primarily with the Unix SA’s assessing host downtime and how best to mitigate impact. The main focus of this time was on analysis of data generated from HP Service Manger; using this data to assess whether or not there was any business impact and to profile the frequency of several key causes.

## Aston Carter
### Recruiter
#### August 2013 - February 2014
While working for Aston Carter, my main responsibilities were split between generating candidates - preferably through recommendations from existing contacts - and generating new business. This was heavily client-facing, I generally favoured approaching with a warm introduction - rather than cold-calling - and began generating significant revenue for the company within the first four weeks.
